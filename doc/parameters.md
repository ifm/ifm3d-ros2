| ~/frame_latency_thresh DEPRECATED?  | float     | 1.0           | Time (seconds) used to determine that timestamps from the camera cannot be trusted. When this threshold is exceeded, when compared to system time, we use the reception time of the frame and not the capture time of the frame.                                                                                                                                                      |
| ~/ip                     | string    | 192.168.0.69  | The ip address of the camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ~/password               | string    |               | The password required to establish an edit session with the camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ~/schema_mask DEPRECATED?           | int16     | 0xf           | The schema mask to apply to the active session with the frame grabber. This determines which images are available for publication from the camera. More about schemas can be gleaned from the ifm3d project                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ~/timeout_millis DEPRECATED?        | int       | 500           | The number of milliseconds to wait for the framegrabber to return new frame data before declaring a "timeout" and to stop blocking on new data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ~/timeout_tolerance_secs DEPRECATED? | float     | 5.0           | The wall time to wait with no new data from the camera before trying to establish a new connection to the camera. This helps to provide robustness against camera cables becoming unplugged or other in-field pathologies which would cause the connection between the ROS node and the camera to be broken.                                                                          |
| ~/sync_clocks DEPRECATED | bool      | false         | Attempt to sync the camera clock to the system clock at start-up. The side-effect is that timestamps on the image should reflect the capture time as opposed to the receipt time. Please note: resolution of this sync is only granular to 1 second. If fine-grained image acquisition times are needed, consider using the on-camera NTP server (available on select camera models). |
| ~/xmlrpc_port            | uint16    | 80            | The TCP port the camera's xmlrpc server is listening on for requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ~/pcic_port              | uint16    | 50010         | The TCP (data) port the camera's pcic server is listening on for requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ~/log_level| string | warning| ifm3d-ros2 node logging level.  |
| ~/tf.cloud_link.frame_name | string |  <node_name>_optical_link | Name for the point cloud frame. |
| ~/tf.cloud_link.publish_transform | bool | true | Whether the transform from the cameras mounting point to the point cloud center should be published. |
| ~/tf.mounting_link.frame_name | string | <node_name>_mounting_link | Name for the mounting point frame. |
| ~/tf.optical_link.frame_name | string | <node_name>_optical_link | Name for the point optical frame. |
| ~/tf.optical_link.publish_transform | bool | true | Whether the transform from the cameras mounting point to the point optical center should be published. |
| ~/tf.optical_link.transform | double array | [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] | Static transform from mounting link to optical link, as [x, y, z, rot_x, rot_y, rot_z] |
| ~/buffer_id_list | string array | {"AMPLITUDE_IMAGE", "NORM_AMPLITUDE_IMAGE", "CONFIDENCE_IMAGE", JPEG_IMAGE", "RADIAL_DISTANCE_IMAGE", "XYZ", "EXTRINSIC_CALIB", } | List of buffer_id strings denoting the wanted buffers. |
