# Diagnostic 

The ifm3d-ros2 package periodically publishes diagnostic information. The diagnostic message contains an error code and a message, referring directly to an error from ifm3d or from the embedded software. 
For more details on the error codes and potential troubleshooting strategies, refer to the [O3R diagnostic documentation](../../../documentation/SoftwareInterfaces/ifmDiagnostic/index_diagnostic.md).
